This is a contacts list application that allows you to add new contacts, delete, and edit already existing ones.
This application uses MongoDB for storing the contact data, Express (framework for node.js) to facilitate writing 
the server code, Angular for the user interface, and Node(server on which the app runs) as the backend.

Once you have these technologies installed, you can simply download and run using:

node server.js

and open a tab on that machine with the following url to render the page:

http://localhost:3000
